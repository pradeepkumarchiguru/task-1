# task-1
This is my first task of sql developer internship.


This GitHub repository provides the SQL script for a **Library Management System database schema**, demonstrating foundational database design concepts. The `library_schema.sql` file includes `CREATE TABLE` statements for core entities like **Authors**, **Books**, **Members**, and **Loans**. It meticulously defines **primary and foreign keys**, alongside unique constraints for fields like ISBN and email, ensuring robust data integrity and proper relationship management. To get started, simply clone this repository and execute the `library_schema.sql` script using your preferred database management tool such as MySQL Workbench, pgAdmin, or SQLiteStudio. This will establish the `LibraryDB` database and all its interconnected tables on your local system. For a visual understanding of the schema, you can conceptualize an Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram where Authors have a one-to-many relationship with Books, and a many-to-many relationship between Members and Books is resolved through the Loans table. Feel free to explore, utilize, or even contribute to this basic yet functional database design.
